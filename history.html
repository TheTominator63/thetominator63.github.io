      <div class="w3-half w3-container" style="font-size:20px">
        <p>In September 2022, The folk club was started by two international students, Gi and Ype, in order to get more young people to play and discover folk music together. This began at the Settle Inn with informal weekly sessions in
which a theme was proposed for people to bring music.</p>
        <p>In January 2023, We started playing a monthly session at Nicky Tam's, where we continue playing to this day! This was in addition to the the meetings at Settle Inn, in which people could practice together and show others new music. </p>

      </div>
      <div class="w3-half w3-container" style="font-size:20px">
        <p>In September 2023, More people had joined the club, so we increased the Nicky Tam's sessions to twice a month, and substituted
the Settle Inn practices for rehearsals at people’s flats.</p>
        <p>In November 2023, We were offered to play at a ceilidh for the Geography Society, so we formed a ceilidh band and practiced intensely for a month, forming sets of music for each dance.<br>In December 2023, We played the ceilidh, which was a fantastic night of music and dancing for all.</p>
      </div>
    <div class="w3-row w3-padding-32">
      <div class="w3-half w3-container" style="font-size:20px">
        <p>Since then, the club is still going strong. The Nicky Tam's sessions have continued the whole time, only growing in popularity and maintaining the same joyous atmosphere. The club has continued gaining members, we now have over 60 people involved!</p>
        <p>We've been on the university's Air3 radio station, played several more ceilidhs, done several café concerts at the Tolbooth, played in the grand hall of Stirling Castle for the Stirling 900 and been on trips to Ullapool, Aviemore and Orkney!</p>
        <p>We hope to keep this going in the future, as it's been a fantastic experience, bringing people together and keeping folk music alive for future generations to learn and enjoy.</p>
